## Seed collection at the University of Michigan's Matthaei Botanical Gardens and Nichols Arboretum

#### environment_parse.rb
Previously the Garden's seed collection data was one large spreadsheet. This script reads through that sheet and creates new spreadsheets for each environment type, so that when mixing seeds for certain environments one can know what seeds to add. To use the script, one should set the correct filepaths and include the 'all species' csv in the same directory.
